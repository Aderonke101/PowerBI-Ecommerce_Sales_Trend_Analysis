# DAX Measures

## Introduction

This document contains a list of 22 essential DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) measures used in data analysis and reporting. These measures help calculate various aspects of sales, quantities, and profits. Below, we explain each measure and its purpose.

### Measures Overview

## 1. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales**
This measure calculates the total sales amount for the current year up to the current date.

## 2. **Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales**
This measure calculates the total sales for the same period in the previous year, helping to compare current performance with past performance.

## 3. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales**
This measure compares sales for the current period to the same period in the previous year, expressed as a percentage change to identify growth or decline.

## 4. **Trend**
This measure tracks the trend of sales over time, often represented as a moving average or growth rate to visualize whether sales are increasing or decreasing.

## 5. **Sales Icon Colour**
This measure applies a color to the sales icon based on the performance of sales, such as green for growth and red for decline.

## 6. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Quantity**
This measure calculates the total quantity sold for the current year up to the current date, providing insights into sales volume over time.

## 7. **Year-to-Date Concatenated Quantity**
This measure concatenates the quantities sold for the current year up to the current date, offering a summarized view of total quantities.

## 8. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Quantity**
This measure compares the quantity sold for the current period to the same period in the previous year, providing insights into growth or decline in volume.

## 9. **Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Quantity**
This measure calculates the total quantity sold for the same period in the previous year, making it easier to compare with the current period’s performance.

## 10. **Quantity Icon Colour**
This measure applies a color to the quantity icon based on performance, with green indicating an increase and red indicating a decrease in quantities sold.

## 11. **Quantity Icon**
This measure displays an icon based on the performance of quantities, such as an upward arrow for growth and a downward arrow for decline.

## 12. **Profit Icon**
This measure displays an icon representing profit performance, such as a smiley face for positive profit and a frown for negative profit.

## 13. **Profit Icon Colour**
This measure applies a color to the profit icon based on performance, with green indicating positive profit and red indicating negative profit.

## 14. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Profit**
This measure calculates the total profit for the current year up to the current date, providing insights into the profitability of sales throughout the year.

## 15. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Profit**
This measure compares the profit for the current period to the same period in the previous year, showing how the profitability has changed year over year.

## 16. **Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Profit**
This measure calculates the total profit for the same period in the previous year, allowing a comparison to the current period’s profit.

## 17. **Profit Margin**
This measure calculates the profit margin, which is the ratio of profit to sales, showing how much of each sale turns into profit.

## 18. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Profit Margin**
This measure calculates the profit margin for the current year up to the current date, providing insights into profitability over time.

## 19. **Year-over-Year (YoY) Profit Margin**
This measure compares the profit Margin for the current period to the same period in the previous year. IT helps evaluate how the profitability of the business has changed over the year, providing a percentage change in the profit margin, which can indicate growth or decline.

## 20. **Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Profit Margin**
This measure calculates the profit margin for the same period in the previous year, making it easier to compare the profit margin to last year's performance.

## 21. **Profit Margin Icon**
This measure displays an icon based on the profit margin, such as an upward icon for positive margins and a downward icon for negative margins.

## 22. **Profit Margin Icon Colour**
This measure applies a color to the profit margin icon, with green indicating a positive margin and red indicating a negative margin.
